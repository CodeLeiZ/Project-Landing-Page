# Project: Landing Page

## Introduction
  In this Project, I embark on the mission of creating a complete web page based on a design provided to me from The Odin Project (TOP) on Foundations Course, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Flexbox</a>.

## Objectives


  The primary objective of this project is to tackle a project from inception to completion. Through this endeavor, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and cultivate the ability to approach challenges systematically. A key focus will be on developing and adhering to organized coding practices, thereby instilling robust habits that promote code clarity and maintainability. Additionally, I aspire to streamline efficiency by minimizing redundant or unnecessary lines of code. Ultimately, this project serves as a platform for self-improvement, aiming to equip myself with the skills and discipline necessary for successful software development endeavors in the future.
